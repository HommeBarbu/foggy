# Foggy

Currently only downloads all the wikis.

Uses a file `fbSettings.py` to load credentials.

``` python
URL = "https://path-to-fogbugz.com"
TOKEN = "{Super secret token}"
``` 

Also uses pandoc to convert to markdown, you'll need a local copy.

Also a couple python packages.

``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
